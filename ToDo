     
4. Fix: in connect.py, this is going to overwrite pretype1 dictionary with pretype2 dictionary
                syncomps,connect_list[syntype]=connect_timetable(post_connections[syntype][pretype],syncomps,totalsyn,netparams)
   Fix: Note that only adding plasticity to synapse[0] (plasticity.py)
   Fix: Need to plot synchan current or conductance of some compartments
   	same as calcium comps if calYN (net_output and net_graph)
	independent subset of synchans if network and no calcium
	all connected synchans if single (possibly add NMDA also in tables.syn_plastabs)
	    fix syn_graph to plot multiple types of synchans, each in separate graph panel, and fix table name to facilitate extraction of syn type
   Fix: only plotting one synapse connected to each timetable -sh.synapse[0] in add_one_table in tables.py.

5. Code Refinements
   A. refine NamedLists for connections to specify post-syn location dependence (optional)
   B. refine select_branch to make use of location dependence 
   C. refine count_presyn to account for a. non-dist dependence, and multiple connections per neuron with location dependence
                                         b. 3D arrays of elements
   D. test/debug case where neurons to have both intrinsic (pre-cell) and extern (timetable) inputs of same syntype
   E: Think about how to connect two different networks, e.g. striatum and GP

6.Types of spike train correlations
  1. number of synaptic terminals between single axon and single neuron
       parameter specifying range or mean number.  Randomly select how many and repeat calls to
           synpath,syncomps=select_entry(syncomps)
           synconn(synpath,dist,presyn_tt,netparams.mindelay)
  2. with and between neuron correlation due to correlation of the cortical region projecting to striatum
      account for both of these (same source) with correlated spike trains
  3.  between neuron correlations because a single axon can contact multiple neurons
       implement using parameter syn_per_tt - associated with table object
       this will also allow multiple synapses within single neuron, but unlikely if large neuron population

#to eliminate MSNsyn, need to change specification of the synapse in plastic_synapse
#PYTHONPATH=. py.test -v
#PYTHONPATH=. py.test -v -x to stop after 1st failure (and print the problem)
#PYTHONPATH=. py.test -v -x -k"test_net_injection[]" to execute a single test
#PYTHONPATH=. py.test -v -x -k"test_net_injection" to execute all network test

#git grep -e test_plasticity -l|xargs sed -i s/test_plasticity/plasticity_test/g

-e because git is stupid and will not recognize -l otherwise
-l list filenames only
|xargs: pipe into sed
-i inplace (don't print to standard output, instead overwrite original file)
s/string1/string2/ replace string1 with string2
g more than one string per line
